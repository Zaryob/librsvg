The code in this directory is a GTK+ theme engine based on librsvg and 
the gdk-pixbuf theme engine. 

Over time, this engine will look less like the gdk-pixbuf engine and 
really show off the power of librsvg and the concept of using SVG as a
toolkit theming library.

The config files are meant to be compatible with the gdk-pixbuf theme
engine, with the notable exception that the images must be SVG graphics
and not raster graphics (i.e. PNG, JPEG, ...)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code in this directory is a GTK+ theme engine based on the earlier
pixmap theme engine.

The config files are meant to be compatible, but instead of rendering
using Imlib, it renders using GdkPixbuf.  This makes the memory
management much more understandable, and also allows us to use
GdkPixbuf's high quality scaling.

Most of the code was reworked/rewritten in the process to make it more
understandable and maintainable.

There are lots of bugs here, a considersable number of bugs. But it's
cleaned up a great deal from the older pixmap engine. Please don't
make it uglier again.
